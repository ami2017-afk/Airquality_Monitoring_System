# Airquality_Monitoring_System

An Air Pollution Monitoring System based on IoT technology is being proposed, which aims to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time and store the collected data on the cloud for easy access. With air pollution being a major global concern affecting the environment, economy, and human health, this system is designed to measure the levels of hazardous gases, temperature, and humidity using Parts per Million metrics. The system employs sensors to continuously monitor these parameters and transmit the collected data to the embedded controller. In case of hazardous gas levels exceeding the permissible limits, the system triggers a simple alert and LED indicator to notify users.
